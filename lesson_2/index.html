						<p>Throughout history, secret societies, mysterious brotherhoods, and military orders have shaped the political and
						military landscape of their time. Among them, the <b>Assassins</b> and <b>Templars</b> stand out as two legendary factions whose
						rivalry influenced medieval history and continues to captivate modern audiences.<br></p>
						<p>The Assassins were masters of stealth and subterfuge, eliminating powerful figures through carefully planned
						assassinations. The Templars, on the other hand, were an elite military order with immense wealth, power, and influence
						over European politics and finance. Their ideological and strategic clash has become a central theme in modern fiction,
						especially in the <i>Assassin’s Creed</i> series. <br></p>
						<p>But who were the real Assassins and Templars? How did their paths cross, and what secrets does history hide about them?
						Let’s explore their origins, tactics, and ultimate fate.</p>

						<div id="origins" class="origins__title">
							<h3>Origins and Principles of the Order</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="origins__text">
							<p>The Order of Assassins emerged in the late 11th century in Persia and Syria. Its founder, <b>Hassan-i Sabbah</b>, was a
							brilliant strategist and religious leader who created a network of devoted followers. They were members of the <b>Nizari
							Ismaili sect of Islam</b> and saw themselves as warriors fighting against their enemies, including the Seljuk Empire and the
							Crusaders.<br></p>
							<p>Rather than engaging in open warfare, the Assassins specialized in targeted killings of key political and military
							figures. Their name is believed to come from the Arabic word <i>ḥašīšiyyīn</i>, which some claim means "hashish users,"
							although the true meaning remains debated.</p>

						<div id="tactics" class="tactics__title">
							<h3>Tactics and Methods</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="tactics__text">
							<p>The Assassins' success lay in their highly sophisticated tactics:</p>
							<ul class="tactics__items">
								<li class="tactics__item"><b>Disguise and infiltration</b> – They lived among their enemies, sometimes for years, before striking.</li>
								<li class="tactics__item"><b>Careful planning</b> – Every assassination was meticulously prepared, considering the habits and routines of the target.</li>
								<li class="tactics__item"><b>Precision over chaos</b> – They killed only specific individuals rather than waging large-scale battles.</li>
								<li class="tactics__item"><b>Hidden weapons</b> – Daggers, poison, and small concealed blades were their tools of choice.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Their most famous stronghold was <b>Alamut Castle</b>, located in present-day Iran. It served as a training center where
							initiates learned philosophy, martial arts, and strategic warfare.</p>

						<div id="fall" class="fall-history__title">
							<h3>The Fall of the Order</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="fall-history__text">
							<p>Despite their cunning tactics, the Assassins could not withstand the overwhelming force of the Mongols. In 1256, <b>Hulagu
							Khan</b>, the grandson of Genghis Khan, led a devastating campaign against them, destroying Alamut and other Assassin
							fortresses. Although remnants of the Order continued to operate for a while, their influence eventually faded.</p>

							<h3>The Birth of the Order</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="birth__text">
							<p>The <b>Knights Templar</b>, officially known as the <b>Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon</b>, were founded
							in 1119 in Jerusalem. Their initial mission was to protect Christian pilgrims traveling to the Holy Land. However, over
							time, the Templars evolved into one of the most powerful military and financial organizations in medieval Europe.</p>
							<p>Templar knights wore distinctive <b>white cloaks with a red cross</b> and were renowned for their discipline, martial skills,
							and unwavering faith.</p>

							<h3>Wealth and Influence</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="wealt__text">
							<p>The Templars became immensely wealthy and powerful through various means:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Financial services</b> – They established an early banking system, allowing travelers to deposit money in one location and
								withdraw it elsewhere.</li>
								<li><b>Land ownership</b> – They controlled vast estates across Europe, from France to England and Spain.</li>
								<li><b>Political influence</b> – They advised and even financed kings, shaping the fate of kingdoms.</li>
							</ul>

						<div id="downfall" class="downfall__title">
							<h3>Downfall: Betrayal and Suppression</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="downfall__text">
							<p>Their growing power made them enemies, particularly <b>King Philip IV of France</b>, who owed them massive debts. On <b>Friday,
							October 13, 1307</b>, he orchestrated the arrest of the Templars, accusing them of <b>heresy, devil worship, and corrupt
							practices</b>. Under torture, many confessed to fabricated crimes, leading to the order's downfall.</p>
							<p>In 1312, Pope Clement V officially dissolved the Knights Templar. Their last Grand Master, <b>Jacques de Molay</b>, was burned
							at the stake in 1314. Before his execution, he reportedly cursed King Philip and Pope Clement, both of whom died within
							a year, fueling legends of the Templars' vengeance.</p>
							<p>Some believe that surviving Templars <b>fled to Scotland or Portugal</b>, where they continued their activities under different
							names.</p>

						<h2><mark>Assassins vs. Templars: A Historical Feud or Fictional Rivalry?</mark></h2>
					</div>
					<div class="versus-history__text">
						<p>Although there is little evidence that Assassins and Templars frequently clashed in real history, their rivalry has
						become legendary, especially in popular culture.</p>
						<p>In the <i>Assassin’s Creed</i> series, the <b>Assassins</b> are portrayed as fighters for freedom, opposing the <b>Templars</b>, who seek
						absolute control over humanity. However, both historical orders had striking similarities:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Strict hierarchy and discipline</b> – Both groups followed a rigid code of conduct.</li>
							<li><b>Secrecy and intelligence networks</b> – Each order maintained a web of spies and informants.</li>
							<li><b>Ideological warfare</b> – They saw themselves as upholding a higher purpose.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The main difference? The Assassins relied on precision and subterfuge, while the Templars wielded military and economic
						power.</p>

					<div class="legacy-history__text">
						<p>Today, the legends of these secretive orders continue to inspire conspiracy theories, historical research, and
						entertainment.</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Books and Movies</b> – The Templars feature in <i>The Da Vinci Code</i> and <i>National Treasure</i>, while the Assassins remain a subject
							of historical fascination.</li>
							<li><b>Video Games</b> – <i>Assassin’s Creed</i> introduced millions to the Assassin-Templar conflict.</li>
							<li><b>Modern Conspiracy Theories</b> – Some claim the <b>Freemasons</b> are descendants of the Templars, while others believe the

						<p>The Assassins and Templars left an indelible mark on history and culture. Their struggle was not just about power but
						about ideology—one side valuing secrecy and precision, the other striving for dominance and control.</p>
						<p>But who was truly right? Were the Assassins freedom fighters or cold-blooded killers? Were the Templars noble warriors
						or ruthless schemers?</p>
