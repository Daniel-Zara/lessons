						<h3>Introduction to Ukraine</h3>
						<p>Ukraine is a country located in Eastern Europe, known for its incredible historical depth, diverse culture, and stunning landscapes. The country’s history spans millennia, with various civilizations contributing to the unique identity it carries today. From the fertile plains of its central regions to the picturesque Carpathian Mountains, Ukraine offers a wide range of cultural, historical, and natural beauty. This article explores the geography, cultural heritage, political landscape, economy, and modern-day achievements of Ukraine, celebrating the resilience and determination of its people.</p>

					<h2>Geography: The Heart of Eastern Europe</h2>
					<div class="geography__content">
						<!-- location -->
						<div id="location" class="geography__location location-geography">
							<h3>Strategic Location in Europe</h3>
							<p>Ukraine’s geographical location places it at the crossroads of Eastern and Western Europe. It is bordered by Russia to the east, Belarus to the north, Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary to the west, Romania and Moldova to the southwest, and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south. With an area of 603,500 square kilometers, Ukraine is the largest country entirely within Europe.</p>
							<p>This strategic position has played a significant role in Ukraine's cultural and political development. Throughout history, Ukraine has been influenced by both Western European and Eastern traditions, making it a melting pot of different cultures.</p>
						</div>
						<!-- landscape -->
						<div style="color: darkmagenta;" id="landscape" class="geography__landscape landscape-geography">
							<h3>A Diverse Landscape</h3>
							<p>Ukraine’s landscape is incredibly diverse, offering a combination of plains, mountains, rivers, and coastlines. In the central and southern regions, the vast steppes are characterized by rich, fertile soil, making the country one of the leading agricultural producers in the world. The plains are often referred to as the "breadbasket of Europe" due to the abundance of wheat, corn, and other crops that are grown here.</p>
							<p style="color: blue;">To the west, the <b>Carpathian Mountains</b> provide a sharp contrast, offering rugged terrain, dense forests, and peaceful valleys. This region is not only home to unique wildlife but also serves as a popular destination for hiking, skiing, and eco-tourism.</p>
							<p>Along the southern edge of Ukraine, the <b>Black Sea</b> and <b>Sea of Azov</b> coastlines offer beautiful beaches and vital access to trade routes. The coastal areas also boast numerous resorts, making them attractive spots for both local and international tourism.</p>
						</div>
						<!-- waterways -->
						<div id="waterways" class="geography__waterways waterways-geography">
							<!-- priority tag "style" not css -->
							<h3>Rivers and Waterways</h3> 
							<p>Ukraine is blessed with numerous rivers, with the <b>Dnieper River</b> being the most significant. Flowing from north to south, it divides the country into eastern and western regions. The Dnieper has played an important role throughout Ukraine’s history, serving as a vital waterway for trade, transportation, and the development of settlements along its banks.</p>
							<p>In the southwest, the <b>Danube River</b>, one of the longest rivers in Europe, forms part of Ukraine's border with Romania and provides access to the Black Sea. This river has been historically significant as a route for trade and cultural exchange.</p>

						<!-- ancient -->
						<div id="ancient" class="history__ancient ancient-history">
							<h3>Ancient Civilizations and Greek Influence</h3>
							<p>The earliest evidence of human activity in Ukraine dates back to the Paleolithic period. Various ancient cultures, including the <b>Scythians</b>, <b>Sarmatians</b>, and <b>Thraco-Cimmerians</b>, have left significant archaeological traces. These early inhabitants influenced the development of the land, shaping both its culture and traditions.</p>
							<p>The Greek colonies along the Black Sea coast, particularly in areas like <b>Chersonesus</b> (modern-day Sevastopol), were among the first advanced civilizations to settle in what is now Ukraine. The Greeks brought trade, culture, and technological advances to the region, leaving a legacy that can still be seen in the architecture and artifacts discovered throughout the country.</p>
						</div>	
						<!-- identity -->
						<div id="identity" class="history__identity identity-history">
							<h3>Kyivan Rus: The Birth of Ukrainian Identity</h3>
							<p>The <b>Kyivan Rus</b>, a federation of Slavic tribes, emerged around the 9th century and is often considered the cultural and political precursor to modern Ukraine. Kyiv, the capital city, became the heart of the Kyivan Rus and served as a hub for trade, culture, and politics.</p>
							<p>During this time, the state grew to become one of the largest and most powerful in Europe. It played a vital role in the spread of Christianity in Eastern Europe, and <b>Kyiv</b> itself was home to magnificent churches and monasteries, some of which remain important cultural landmarks today.</p>
						</div>
						<!-- hetmanate -->
						<div id="hetmanate" class="history__hetmanate hetmanate-history">
							<h3>The Cossack Hetmanate and the Struggle for Autonomy</h3>
							<p>After the decline of Kyivan Rus, Ukraine became part of several foreign empires, including the <b>Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</b> and the <s>Russian Empire</s>. However, in the 17th century, the <b>Cossacks</b>, a group of fiercely independent warriors, formed the <b>Cossack Hetmanate</b> in an effort to reclaim autonomy.</p>
							<p>While the Hetmanate ultimately fell under Russian control, the Cossacks’ legacy remains a key symbol of Ukrainian resilience and national pride. The period also marked the beginning of Ukraine’s desire for self-rule, a theme that would recur throughout the country’s history.</p>

					<h2>Cultural Heritage: A Tapestry of Traditions</h2>
					<div class="tradition__content">
						<!-- language -->
						<div id="language" class="tradition__language language-tradition">
							<h3>Language and Literature: A Deep Cultural Identity</h3>
							<p>The Ukrainian language is a central element of the nation’s identity. Though it shares linguistic roots with Russian and Belarusian, the Ukrainian language is distinct, with its own vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. Over the centuries, the Ukrainian language has survived many attempts to suppress it, but today it is a proud symbol of national unity.</p>
							<p>Ukrainian literature also plays a crucial role in shaping the country's identity. Writers such as <b>Taras Shevchenko</b>, <b>Ivan Franko</b>, and <b>Lesya Ukrainka</b> are celebrated for their contributions to Ukrainian culture. Their works explore themes of national consciousness, independence, and the struggles faced by the Ukrainian people.</p>
							<p>Shevchenko, in particular, is considered a national hero for his poetry and paintings, which inspired generations of Ukrainians to embrace their heritage and fight for their rights.</p>
						</div>
						<!-- music -->
						<div id="music" class="tradition__music music-tradition">
							<h3>Traditional Music and Dance: Rhythms of the Soul</h3>
							<p>Ukrainian music and dance are vibrant expressions of the nation's spirit and resilience. Folk music, deeply rooted in rural traditions, is often performed with instruments like the bandura and kobza, both of which have been part of Ukrainian culture for centuries. These instruments produce melodies that are both haunting and uplifting, capturing the essence of the land and its people.</p>
							<p>Ukrainian folk dances, such as the <b>hopak</b>, are characterized by energetic leaps, spins, and acrobatic moves. The hopak is often performed at celebrations, festivals, and national events, symbolizing the strength and vitality of the Ukrainian people.</p>
						</div>
						<!-- cuisine -->
						<div id="cuisine" class="tradition__cuisine cuisine-tradition">
							<h3>Ukrainian Cuisine: A Flavorful Tradition</h3>
							<p>Ukrainian cuisine is hearty, flavorful, and deeply tied to the country's agricultural heritage. Some of the most famous dishes include <b>borscht</b> (a beet-based soup), <b>varenyky</b> (dumplings filled with potatoes, cheese, or fruit), and <b>holubtsi</b> (stuffed cabbage rolls). Meals are typically accompanied by salo (cured pork fat), a traditional snack that is enjoyed with bread and horseradish.</p>
							<p>Food plays a central role in Ukrainian culture, particularly during family gatherings and holidays. The <b>Easter</b> and <b>Christmas</b> celebrations are marked by special meals that are full of symbolism and history.</p>

								<h3>Post-Soviet Transformation</h3>
							</div>
							<p>Following Ukraine’s independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, the country faced significant political and economic challenges. With the collapse of the USSR, Ukraine sought to establish a democratic government, but corruption, political instability, and economic hardship plagued the country during its early years.</p>
							<p>However, despite these struggles, Ukraine has made significant progress. Over the last two decades, Ukraine has taken important steps toward democracy, with free elections and increased political participation from the population.</p>
						</div>
						<!-- current -->

							<h3>Current Political System</h3>
							<p>Ukraine operates as a <b>presidential-parliamentary republic</b> with a <b>multiparty system</b>. The President, elected every five years, serves as the head of state, while the Prime Minister, appointed by the President and approved by the parliament, is the head of government.</p>
							<p>The <b>Verkhovna Rada</b>, Ukraine's legislature, plays a significant role in shaping the country’s policies and laws. While the political system is still evolving, Ukraine’s democratic institutions are becoming stronger with time.</p>
